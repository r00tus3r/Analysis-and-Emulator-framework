Tool to emulate binaries of different architectures and do binary analysis. Developed using pylibelf+unicorn.

It is a fun project I am working on. It can do the following and more when it is fully complete:

1. Trace instructions
2. Trace syscalls
3. Trace memory accesses

The utility functions will help:

1. Dump memory mappings
2. Dump register values
3. Given a address and a length, do a hexdump of the bytes there

It is still a work in progress. When complete, it will be useful for debugging and analysing binaries of different architectures.

I try work on it whenever I am free.
